html stands for HyperText Markup Language.
 It is the standard language used to create and design webpages.
  HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to structure content,
   such as text, images, links, and other multimedia elements,
    allowing web browsers to display them correctly.


    we are going to learn about the basic structure of an HTML document.
     An HTML document typically consists of several key components:
1. <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
 It helps browsers understand how to interpret the content.

2. <html>: This is the root element that wraps all the content of the HTML document.

3. <head>: This section contains meta-information about the document, 
    such as the title, character set, stylesheets, and scripts. 
    It is not displayed directly on the webpage.

4. <title>: This tag, placed within the <head> section, defines the title of the webpage,
    which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.


5. <body>: This section contains the main content of the webpage,
    including text, images, links, and other elements that are visible to users.


    in html we use tags to create elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets <>.
     Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.
      The closing tag is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (/)
       before the element name. For example, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph,
        and </p> is the closing tag.  -->


Here is a simple example of an HTML document structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
