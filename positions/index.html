<!--

positions in css are used to specify how an element is positioned in a document.
 The five main position values are:
1. static
2. relative 
3. absolute
4. fixed
5. sticky

static: This is the default position value. Elements with static positioning are placed in the normal document flow.
relative: Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to their normal position. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust their position.
absolute: Elements with absolute positioning are removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value other than static). If there is no such ancestor, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
fixed: Elements with fixed positioning are removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the viewport. They remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.
sticky: Elements with sticky positioning toggle between relative and fixed positioning based on the user's scroll position. They behave like relative elements until they reach a specified offset from the viewport, at which point they become fixed.
