<!--

the <tag> is used to create and define elements in an HTML document,
 essentially telling the web browser how to display the content.
 Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., <a>) that marks the beginning of an element,
 and a closing tag (e.g., </a>) that marks the end.
 Some tags, like <img>, are self-closing and do not have a closing tag.
 Tags structure the webpage by marking headings, paragraphs,
 links, images, and other content, but they themselves are not visible in the browser.
  Together, these tags build the backbone of a web page</tag>





<headtag> is used to define the head section of an HTML document. 
The head section contains meta-information about the document,
 such as its title, character set, styles, and links to external resources.

 its main purpose is to provide information that is not directly displayed on the webpage
  but is essential for the proper functioning and presentation of the content.

Here is an example of how to use the <head> tag in an HTML document:  -->




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

    <title>our first page </title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
