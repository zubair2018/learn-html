 <!-- textformaters are tools or libraries used to manipulate and format text in various ways.
They can be used to change the case of text, add or remove whitespace,
 format dates and numbers, and apply styles such as bold or italics.
 Text formatters are commonly used in web development,
 document processing, and data presentation to ensure that text is
  displayed in a consistent and readable manner.
Examples of text formatters include Markdown processors,
 HTML formatters, and programming language libraries for string manipulation.

In web development, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is often used as a text formatter
    to structure and style content on webpages.
    By using various HTML tags and attributes, developers can control how text appears,
    including its font, size, color, alignment, and other stylistic elements.


    examples of text formatting tags in HTML include:

1. <b> and <strong>: Used to make text bold.
2. <i> and <em>: Used to italicize text.
3. <u>: Used to underline text.
4. <br>: Inserts a line break.
5. <p>: Defines a paragraph.
6. <h1> to <h6>: Define headings of different levels.
7. <span>: Used to apply styles to a specific section of text within a larger block.
These tags help enhance the readability and visual appeal of text content on webpages.
